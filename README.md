# Global Happiness Report Predictive Analysis and Web Visualization

## Project Summary

This project involves a comprehensive data science pipeline based on five years of the World Happiness Report dataset. The work consists of two primary phases: extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the development of a predictive machine learning model. The final results, including the model's predictions for a synthetic, imaginary country, are presented via a professional, interactive web interface built with React.

## Analytical & Presentation Focus 

This project demonstrates the ability to execute an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from complex data ingestion to professional visualization:

* Advanced Data Analysis: Performed deep temporal and cross-sectional analysis on macro-economic and social indicators to understand drivers of national well-being.

* Predictive Modeling: Developed and tuned a regression-based machine learning model to accurately predict happiness scores based on underlying economic and social factors.

* Full-Stack Data Visualization: Successfully integrated Python data science outputs with a modern React frontend to deliver clear, interactive data insights to the user.

## Technical Scope & Components

The project utilizes a split architecture combining Python for computation and React for the user interface:

* Data Source: World Happiness Report Dataset (5 years of data).

* Modeling & Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) for ETL, feature engineering, and predictive regression modeling.

* Presentation Layer: React (JavaScript/JSX) used to create a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) for visualizing historical data and displaying model predictions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is logically divided into two primary sections: the core data science engine and the web application:

* Documentation/: Contains all the documentations related to the project. 

* Python ML Model/: Contains Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts detailing the 5-year data analysis, EDA, feature selection process, and the final trained predictive model code.

* Tableau Analysis/: Contains the Tableau analysis. 

* WHR React/: Contains the complete React application code, including components, styling, and the main logic for displaying the dataset visualizations and the prediction results.

* Website Layout/: Contains the website layout images. 

* World Happiness Report Dataset/: Anonymized or sample data files used for the project.
